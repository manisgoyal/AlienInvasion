# Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python

I started this project on `24/09/2020`. It is the first project of Part - II of the book:
</br>
### PYTHON CRASH COURSE 2ND EDITION
_A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming_

In the Alien Invasion project (Chapters 12, 13, and 14), you’ll use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. At the end of the project, you’ll have learned skills that will enable you to develop your own 2D games in Pygame.</br>

I claim no ownership of the code and it all belongs to the author [___Eric
 Matthes___](https://github.com/ehmatthes) and the publishers.
 
 ### General Gameplay
 In _Alien Invasion_, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the
  bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
