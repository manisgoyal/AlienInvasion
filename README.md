# Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python

I started this project on `24/09/2020`. It is the first project of Part - II of the book:
</br>
### PYTHON CRASH COURSE 2ND EDITION
_A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming_

In the Alien Invasion project (Chapters 12, 13, and 14), you’ll use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. At the end of the project, you’ll have learned skills that will enable you to develop your own 2D games in Pygame.</br>

I claim no ownership of the code and it all belongs to the author [___Eric Mathews___](https://github.com/ehmatthes) and the publishers.
